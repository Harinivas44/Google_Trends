# Overview

The Google Trends project allows you to explore and visualize the popularity of keywords over time. With a simple Python script, you can discover trends, find out which regions are most interested in a topic, and even uncover related search queries. ðŸš€

## How to Use

- Enter Keywords: Run the script and input your keywords, separating them with commas when prompted. For example, you can enter "Artificial Intelligence."

- Visualize Trends: The script will fetch data from Google Trends and generate various visualizations:

    * A line graph showing the interest in your chosen keyword over time.
    * A bar chart displaying the top regions interested in your keyword (Top-10).
    * Another bar chart presenting the top related search queries.
    * And a final bar chart showing the rising search queries related to your keyword.

## Usage

```javascript
pip install pandas numpy pytrends plotly
```
* Clone the repository or download the script.
* Run the Python script.
* Enter your keywords when prompted.
* Explore the generated visualizations to gain insights into your chosen topic.
